Input data
----------
###foout.dat
1 - A file header of 4 lines:
TITLE     = "Insert your title here"
VARIABLES = "X"
"Y"
"Z"

2 - followed by a reoccuring data header of 5 lines:  
ZONE T="Rectangular zone"  
 STRANDID=0, SOLUTIONTIME=0  
 I=250, J=250, K=1, ZONETYPE=Ordered  
 DATAPACKING=POINT  
 DT=(SINGLE SINGLE SINGLE )

where 'I', 'J' and 'K' determine the dimensions of the defined surface.  
3 - Followed by I*J*K lines, each defining a vertex of the surface.  
e.g. -2.500000000E+00 -2.000000000E+00 0.000000000E+00

Parts 2 and 3 can be repeated indefinitely.

###state.dat
Repeating 5 lines containing data in a specific order.

line 1: zeitschritt, gra1, gra2, gra3  
line 2: uship, vship, wship, upkt, vpkt, wpkt  
line 3: ome1, ome2, ome3, ppkt, qpkt, rpkt  
line 4: ang1, ang2, ang3, ang1p, ang2p, ang3p  
line 5: Xor, Yor, Zor, Ufest, Vfest, Wfest  

This structure can be repeated indefinitely.

###Ship mesh file (optional)
Here a previously created mesh file can be specified to be used in the animation process.
.STL and .PLY files are applicable.
